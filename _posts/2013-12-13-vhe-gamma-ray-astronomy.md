title: "Very High Energy Ground Based Gamma Ray Telescopy Using TACTIC"
date: 2013-12-13
project: true
excerpt: "This project is a study of VHE gamma ray astronomy using atmospheric Cherenkov technique. The project involved the study of processes of interaction of gamma rays, formation of extensive air showers, imaging of the Cherenkov radiation and data analysis of the observed data of Crab Nebula and MRK421 using TACTIC at Mt. Abu, India."

## I. Introduction

In order to study the various processes and objects of the universe, electromagnetic radiation and particles emitted from them act as information messenger. But to observe all these radiation and particles directly is very seldom as most of them get deflected or interrupted by interstellar medium or other objects. As gamma rays are very less affected by these interactions, they are a very good source of information about the source object. The direction, energy and temporal spread of these rays reveal the important information about the processes going on at these sources.

## II. Sources of Gamma rays

### A. Supernova and Supernova Remanants
Supernovae are energetic stellar explosions that are usually triggered in a variety of ways. They play a critical role in high energy astrophysics for many reasons, among them the production of heavy elements, the formation of new stars, and the acceleration of cosmic rays. Some are also used as standard candles for measurements of distance on the cosmological scale.
